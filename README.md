Setting up Android Studio was a little difficult because as I found I needed to make some configuration adjustments in my computer.

So I am using an HP with AMD processor.

On trying to set up the emulator I ran into issues, which from searching on Google I found I had to enable  the virtualisation settings of my system.

That done I was finally able to set up the emulator.
